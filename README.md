## Summary

Data Structures used:
Linked List, Queue, Stack, & Graph\
This project is an implementation of the Dijkstra's Algorithm and Graph Data Structure to find the shortest path between two buildings/areas in GIKI. It uses contents learned in our course and lab to implement a solution of maps and navigation. The graphical user interface is generated by SFML Library to visually display the destinations and the shortest path. The logic of the shortest path is implemented by Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm which is a function of the Graph Data Structure. The user inputs of destinations are stored in a Queue Data Structure. Linked List is implemented as an adjacency list in the graph Data Structure. The locations coordinates, junction coordinates and junction connections coordinates are saved in text files which are read in the main file, these become the points of the graph to compute the shortest path. When the read  data is in reverse order, a Stack Data Structure is used to reverse those coordinates.
